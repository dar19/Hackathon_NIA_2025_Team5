<h2><b> Hackathon - September 2025 </b></h2>
<h3>Venue : National Institute on Aging (NIA/NIH)</h3>

<3h3>Created/Managed By: Dr. Showkat A. Dar (Maragkakis Lab)</h3>

<h2> Welcome !!!</h2>

Join us for a hands-on bioinformatics hackathon where you’ll build and benchmark ML models to predict the efficacy of chemically-modified siRNAs, a critical step in next-generation RNAi therapeutics. You’ll work with a curated dataset of 4,500+ experimentally validated 21-mer siRNA sequences carrying 30 distinct chemical modifications, turning raw sequence and modification flags into powerful predictive features. Ideal participants have a foundation in Python and scikit-learn (Jupyter notebooks preferred), but we’ll provide starter code and guidance no deep-learning background required (can start with absolute zero experience). Best of all, the modeling methods you learn here feature engineering, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, SVMs, and even prototype 1D-CNNs are fully transferable to any research domain where sequence, image, or tabular data drive discovery. Ready to jumpstart your ML/AI journey and make a real impact on drug design?

<h2> Project Overview </h2>
  
You will work with a high-quality, curated dataset containing over 4,500 experimentally validated 21-mer siRNA sequences. These sequences include 30 distinct chemical modifications that influence efficacy. The goal is to transform raw sequence data and modification flags into informative features to accurately predict siRNA efficacy.

This project provides a unique opportunity to:
Learn feature engineering for biological sequences with chemical modification data.
Build and compare a variety of machine learning models including Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and prototype 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Develop skills transferable to many domains where sequence, image, or tabular data are central.
Contribute to cutting-edge drug design research with practical impact.

<h2>Who Should Participate?</h2>
Python programmers with a basic understanding of machine learning (preferably familiar with scikit-learn).
Beginners eager to learn ML concepts applied to bioinformatics and drug design.
Participants with no prior deep learning experience—starter code and comprehensive guidance will be provided.
Anyone passionate about applying ML to solve real-world biomedical problems.
